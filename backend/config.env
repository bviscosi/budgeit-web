# PLAID_PRODUCTS is a comma-separated list of products to use when
# initializing Link, e.g. PLAID_PRODUCTS=auth,transactions.
# see https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-products for a complete list.
# Only institutions that support ALL listed products will be displayed in Link.
# If you don't see the institution you want in Link, remove any products you aren't using.
# Important: When moving to Production, make sure to update this list with only the products
# you plan to use. Otherwise, you may be billed for unneeded products.
# NOTE: Income_verification has to be used seperately from all other products due to the specific 
# flow.
PLAID_PRODUCTS=auth,transactions
# PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES is a comma-separated list of countries to use when
# initializing Link, e.g. PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=US,CA.
# see https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#link-token-create-request-country-codes for a complete list
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=US,CA
# Only required for OAuth:
# For sandbox, set PLAID_REDIRECT_URI to 'http://localhost:3000/'
# The OAuth redirect flow requires an endpoint on the developer's website
# that the bank website should redirect to. You will need to configure
# this redirect URI for your client ID through the Plaid developer dashboard
# at https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api.
# For development or production, you will need to use an https:// url
# Instructions to create a self-signed certificate for localhost can be found at https://github.com/plaid/quickstart/blob/master/README.md#testing-oauth
# If you are not set up to use localhost with https:// on your system, you will be unable to test OAuth in development or production.
# In this case you can leave the PLAID_REDIRECT_URI blank.
